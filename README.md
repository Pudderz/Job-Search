## Demo

**[Demo]()** 


## Websites it can scrape information from
* LinkedIn
* Indeed
* Reed
* JobSite


## Summary
This project is designed to scrape job websites such as reed, jobsite, linkedin and indeed. This works by creating a nodejs puppeteer server and requesting information from that site.

I created this as I enjoyed making the job filter design challenge from one of my [github repos]() (frontendmentor.io challenge) I created to try and get as close to the design as possible and wanted to do more with it. I also was not able to get the apis for each job website so I thought this would be a fun challenge to learn about puppeteer and how to scrape job websites for information.
